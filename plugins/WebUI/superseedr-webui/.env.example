# Frontend Configuration
# Note: Since the frontend is built to static files and served by Nginx, 
# this var is used at build time by Vite.
# For runtime configuration in Docker, we would need to inject it into window object.
# For now, we assume the API is relative or at a fixed location.
# However, since the frontend runs on host port 19557 and backend on 19556,
# using localhost:19556 is fine for client-side fetches if the user accesses via localhost.
